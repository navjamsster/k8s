TLS Configuration
What TLS Does:

Encrypts traffic between client and Ingress
Protects hero data in transit
Provides HTTPS access
Uses certificate from secret
TLS Termination:

Ingress decrypts HTTPS traffic
Forwards HTTP to backend services
Services don't need TLS certificates


Key Concepts
Ingress Resource
Entry point for external traffic with routing rules

TLS Secret
Contains certificate and private key for HTTPS

Path-Based Routing
Routes requests based on URL paths

Service Backend
Target service for routed traffic
